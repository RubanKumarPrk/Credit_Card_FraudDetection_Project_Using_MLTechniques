# Credit_Card_FraudDetection_Project_Using_MLTechniques
in this repository i have created a project for credit card fraud detection using kaggle set data
Project 1 : Credit Card Fraud Detection 
In this Project aim is to  to identify and separate the data to detect the who and all will default their loan in future via ML Techniques by creating a Model to check their accuracy on the given data.
Identified issues in the data and using pandas help i performed some cleaning operation to clean the data also analysed information to get insights of the data.
Then using Pre-processing techniques i used to regularize the data to bridge gap between them
Built a Multiple Classification models to find the best model for our Problem and out of all Random Forest and Decision Tree are the best model.
Then for Tuning the model to more accuracy i used both Randomized Search CV and Grid Search CV to find the best parameters to tune the model
Then Finally using Random Forest Classifier Model is best out of all the model for this Data with 78% Accuracy and F1-Score we also plotted Confusion Matrix to check the data accuracy for prediction.
